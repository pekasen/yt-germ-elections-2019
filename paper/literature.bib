	abstract = {Ranked lists are encountered in research and daily life and it is often of interest to compare these lists even when they are incomplete or have only some members in common. An example is document rankings returned for the same query by different search engines. A measure of the similarity between incomplete rankings should handle nonconjointness, weight high ranks more heavily than low, and be monotonic with increasing depth of evaluation; but no measure satisfying all these criteria currently exists. In this article, we propose a new measure having these qualities, namely rank-biased overlap (RBO). The RBO measure is based on a simple probabilistic user model. It provides monotonicity by calculating, at a given depth of evaluation, a base score that is non-decreasing with additional evaluation, and a maximum score that is nonincreasing. An extrapolated score can be calculated between these bounds if a point estimate is required. RBO has a parameter which determines the strength of the weighting to top ranks. We extend RBO to handle tied ranks and rankings of different lengths. Finally, we give examples of the use of the measure in comparing the results produced by public search engines and in assessing retrieval systems in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the quality of videos for patients available on YouTube for learning to self-administer subcutaneous methotrexate. Using the search term “Methotrexate injection,” two clinical reviewers analyzed the first 60 videos on YouTube. Source and search rank of video, audience interaction, video duration, and time since video was uploaded on YouTube were recorded. Videos were classified as useful, misleading, or a personal patient view. Videos were rated for reliability, comprehensiveness, and global quality scale (GQS). Reasons for misleading videos were documented, and patient videos were documented as being either positive or negative towards methotrexate (MTX) injection. Fifty-one English videos overlapped between the two geographic locations; 10 videos were classified as useful (19.6 \%), 14 misleading (27.5 \%), and 27 personal patient view (52.9 \%). Total views of videos were 161,028: 19.2 \% useful, 72.8 \% patient, and 8.0 \% misleading. Mean GQS: 4.2 (±1.0) useful, 1.6 (±1.1) misleading, and 2.0 (±0.9) for patient videos (p {\textless} 0.0001). Mean reliability: 3.3 (±0.6) useful, 0.9 (±1.2) misleading, and 1.0 (±0.7) for patient videos (p {\textless} 0.0001). Comprehensiveness: 2.2 (±1.9) useful, 0.1 (±0.3) misleading, and 1.5 (±1.5) for patient view videos (p = 0.0027). This study demonstrates a minority of videos are useful for teaching MTX injection. Further, video quality does not correlate with video views. While web video may be an additional educational tool available, clinicians need to be familiar with specific resources to help guide and educate their patients to ensure best outcomes.},

Thousands of such videos have been produced, gathering multiple millions of views. Flat Earth discourse sometimes crosses into other public discourse, but YouTube remains singularly important in promoting Flat Earth belief and encouraging development of its supporting arguments. The videos at the source of this stir are highly ambiguous. I argue that this phenomenon represents fusion of multiple influences unique to YouTube, including conspiracy theory, climate change denial, science documentaries, clickbait, viral videos, trolling, Russian propaganda, and young-Earth religious fundamentalism. The phenomenon cannot be properly understood without recognizing the distinct contribution of all of these elements.},

Also like with hacking, we consider the possibility for a range of trolling personas: from black hat trolls who push an agenda that is clearly counter to the interests of the target, to gray hat trolls who exploit vulnerabilities to draw critical attention to unaddressed issues, and white hat trolls who could help proactively disclose vulnerabilities so that attack surface can be reduced. We discuss a variety of trolling techniques from dogpiling to sockpuppetry and also a range of possible interventions.},

Given the apparent dearth of studies on YouTube in this regard, the insights provided here furthers our understanding regarding the drivers of online popularity during election campaigns. Specifically, results indicate that while commenting on uploaded videos appear as related to the ‘thumbs-up’ variety, video view count appear as more clearly related to the dismissive ‘thumbs-down’ feedback option. Discussing these results, the final section of the paper also provides a few suggestions for future research efforts in this vein.},

	abstract = {Health consumers are increasingly using the Internet to search for health information. The existence of overloaded, inaccurate, obsolete, or simply incorrect health information available on the Internet is a serious obstacle for finding relevant and good-quality data that actually helps patients. Search engines of multimedia Internet platforms are thought to help users to find relevant information according to their search. But, is the information recovered by those search engines from quality sources? Is the health information uploaded from reliable sources, such as hospitals and health organizations, easily available to patients? The availability of videos is directly related to the ranking position in YouTube search. The higher the ranking of the information is, the more accessible it is. The aim of this study is to analyze the ranking evolution of diabetes health videos on YouTube in order to discover how videos from reliable channels, such as hospitals and health organizations, are evolving in the ranking. The analysis was done by tracking the ranking of 2372 videos on a daily basis during a 30-day period using 20 diabetes-related queries. Our conclusions are that the current YouTube algorithm favors the presence of reliable videos in upper rank positions in diabetes-related searches.},

YouTube is an influential social media platform, reaching over a billion users worldwide. Its extensive reach attracts professional and amateur video producers who turn to YouTube to inform, entertain and engage global publics. Focusing on YouTube, this study explores the place for journalism within this media ecology. This study uses a mixed-method approach to examine forms of audience engagement to YouTube videos about antimicrobial resistance (AMR), or so called “superbugs”, caused by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. The analysis focuses on the most viewed YouTube videos about AMR between 2016 and 2018, and compares engagement themes expressed in comments to journalistic videos with popular science videos. The most viewed videos about AMR on YouTube are professionally produced educational popular science videos. The qualitative analysis of 3,049 comments identifies seven main forms of high-level engagement, including expressions of emotions, blame and calls for action. This study shows that journalism plays an important role on YouTube by generating audience discussions about social and political accountability. Our findings demonstrate that journalism videos were associated with propositions for political, economic and social/lifestyle actions, while popular science videos were associated with medicines, scientific or pseudo-scientific, and medical practice changes.},

In particular, UGC sites are creating new viewing patterns and social interactions, empowering users to be more creative, and developing new business opportunities. To better understand the impact of UGC systems, we have analyzed YouTube, the world's largest UGC VoD system. Based on a large amount of data collected, we provide an in-depth study of YouTube and other similar UGC systems. In particular, we study the popularity life-cycle of videos, the intrinsic statistical properties of requests and their relationship with video age, and the level of content aliasing or of illegal content in the system. We also provide insights on the potential for more efficient UGC VoD systems (e.g. utilizing P2P techniques or making better use of caching). Finally, we discuss the opportunities to leverage the latent demand for niche videos that are not reached today due to information filtering effects or other system scarcity distortions. Overall, we believe that the results presented in this paper are crucial in understanding UGC systems and can provide valuable information to ISPs, site administrators, and content owners with major commercial and technical implications.},

Neben den technischen Rahmenbedingungen auf Nutzerseite hat die Markteinführung von Videoplattformen wie YouTube (Februar 2005; YouTube, o.

As Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has stated, the Kremlin sees the mass media as a ‘weapon’. Now Russia's leadership is trying to take control of social media too, and for this massive operation a new information warfare tool has been mobilised–-an army of fake social media Putinfans, known as ‘trolls’. My investigation has discovered that coordinated social media propaganda writers are twisting and manipulating the public debate in Finland, too. Trolls and bots distribute vast amounts of false information in various languages, and target individual citizens for aggressive operations. Aggressive trolls have created a feeling of fear among some of my interviewees, causing them to stop making Russia-related comments online. Trolling has had a serious impact on freedom of speech, even outside Russia. Thus, it should be viewed as a national security threat that needs to be addressed accordingly. The question is: how should the Kremlin's trolls and disinformation be countered?},

	abstract = {An edit distance is a measure of the minimum cost sequence of edit operations to transform one structure into another. Edit distance is most commonly encountered within the context of strings, where Wagner and Fischer’s string edit distance is perhaps the most well-known. However, edit distance is not limited to strings. For example, there are several edit distance measures for permutations, including Wagner and Fischer’s string edit distance since a permutation is a special case of a string. However, another edit distance for permutations is Kendall tau distance, which is the number of pairwise element inversions. On permutations, Kendall tau distance is equivalent to an edit distance with adjacent swap as the edit operation. A permutation is often used to represent a total ranking over a set of elements. There exist multiple extensions of Kendall tau distance from total rankings (permutations) to partial rankings (i.e., where multiple elements may have the same rank), but none of these are suitable for computing distance between sequences. We set out to explore extending Kendall tau distance in a different direction, namely from the special case of permutations to the more general case of strings or sequences of elements from some ﬁnite alphabet. We name our distance metric Kendall tau sequence distance, and deﬁne it as the minimum number of adjacent swaps necessary to transform one sequence into the other. We provide two O(n lg n) algorithms for computing it, and experimentally compare their relative performance. We also provide reference implementations of both algorithms in an open source Java library.},

	abstract = {This article presents a set of grounded hypotheses on the interplay between
communication and power relationships in the technological context that characterizes
the network society. Based on a selected body of communication literature, and of a
number of case studies and examples, it argues that the media have become the
social space where power is decided. It shows the direct link between politics, media
politics, the politics of scandal, and the crisis of political legitimacy in a global
perspective. It also puts forward the notion that the development of interactive,
horizontal networks of communication has induced the rise of a new form of
communication, mass self-communication, over the Internet and wireless
communication networks. Under these conditions, insurgent politics and social
movements are able to intervene more decisively in the new communication space.
However, corporate media and mainstream politics have also invested in this new
communication space. As a result of these processes, mass media and horizontal
communication networks are converging. The net outcome of this evolution is a
historical shift of the public sphere from the institutional realm to the new

	abstract = {Bislang lässt die Forschung zum Einfluss des Medienwandels auf die politische Öffentlichkeitsarbeit politische Jugendorganisationen außer Acht. Ziel dieser Studie ist es daher, die Relevanz der sozialen Medien für die Öffentlichkeitsarbeit der Nachwuchsparteien in Deutschland zu explorieren sowie ein erstes Bild der strategischen Nutzungsweise zu gewinnen. In leitfadengestützten Experteninterviews mit den zuständigen Social-Media-Verantwortlichen werden die Einbindung, die Ziele, die Strategien sowie die Frage nach der Evaluation der Social-Media-Arbeit näher beleuchtet. Die Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass die politischen Jugendorganisationen ihre Kommunikationsarbeit überwiegend an die Funktionsweisen und Kommunikationsregeln der sozialen Medien angepasst haben. Allerdings zeigen sich vor allem im Bereich der Evaluation nicht ausgeschöpfte Potenziale.},
